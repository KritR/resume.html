# resume.html
an html based resume based off a json file

renders a resume based on a template ```resume.js``` file given, 
which defines the json object that is your resume. 
This json object is of a custom format and an example can be found
in the [krithik-resume branch](https://github.com/KritR/resume.html/blob/krithik-resume/resume.js).
